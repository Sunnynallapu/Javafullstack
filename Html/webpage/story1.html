                Plastic is incredibly useful and convenient, but it also causes pollution that damages health and the environment.
                In some parts of the world, formal waste disposal services aren’t coping with the amount of waste being created. This is the case in Bangladesh, where Practical Action is working with informal waste workers, local NGOs and the Government to find solutions to the waste crisis.
                Insufficient waste management means that plastic, including recyclable plastic, is dumped on open ground and in rivers. Plastic in rivers can block water channels and pollute sources of fresh water. Burning plastic releases toxic gasses that can cause illness. Plastic waste in landfill releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, including methane, which contribute to the climate crisis.

                From the frozen ice caps of the polar regions to the warm waters of the tropical coral reefs, from deep sea vents to shallow seagrass beds, the oceans contain the greatest diversity of life on Earth. Yet our seas are under threat.
                With a growing awareness of the part that they can play in creating a better future for our oceans, pupils will take a step on the journey to becoming global citizens and sustainability champions of the future.

                The damage plastic does to people’s health and the environment mean that we all need to work together to find solutions to reduce our plastic consumption, while reusing and recycling existing plastic products.
                Explore Practical Action’s approach to waste management further through our Managing Our Waste 2021 report, which calls for a people-centred approach to the waste crisis, including plastic waste. Find out how, rather than focusing on waste flows and particular types of waste, we must turn attention to the waste services people need, and to opportunities for the most marginalised to be a core part of the solution.

                    A lot of plastic waste ends up in the sea. Plastic in the ocean harms marine life and becomes part of the food chain.
                    Around the world, solutions are being developed to fight plastic pollution. Learn about the solutions that are already making a difference in Bangladesh and around the world, and find out the small steps you can take to reduce plastic waste in your own life.
